   <h1><strong>2 Redwood Forest</strong></h1>
   <p>Redwood forest hadn’t always been red.</p>
<p>The aspect of red had gradually spread throughout the forest. Once, the bark covering the trees had been a normal, rather boring brown. It had never been a golden, gleaming brown but it also hadn’t ever been an ugly, unpleasant brown. Now, the bark was red, darker than the red of an apple or the sunset but lighter than the red of roses or blood.</p>
<p>The leaves had also changed, but they hadn’t yet turned as red as the bark. They were orange like a carrot or, well an orange, but in the future, they too would turn red. Below them, the grass was of a similar orange but lighter still, accents of green could still be observed, though it would inevitably fade as more time passes.</p>
<p>Among the grass there were insects as well as creatures of greater height, some feline or canine, red fur covering their bodies. Others had no fur, covered by scales or hide, though they too were red. </p>
<p>Some of the species were longer lived, stronger than others. The red had not yet seeped into them as strongly as others. Traces of brown, green or grey could still be seen all over them and it would take a long time for them to turn red, but not even would they escape the influence of the aspect of red.</p>
<p>In the time before the forest had been red it had held another name, but it hadn’t ever been important. Now, nobody besides scholars or historians would ever hear of what it had been called before. </p>
<p>When hunters or explorers first noticed the red deep within the forest it didn’t seem important and nobody important enough was interested in the forest to warrant changing its name. Then, a few hundred years later, when the red had spread further, when much of the forest had been dyed in its shade, they simply called it <em>redwood forest.</em></p>
<p>Arayel stood within the forest not deep within, nor at the very edges. Below him there was a path, straight, created from the footsteps of a plethora of people over the course of hundreds of years. </p>
<p>Below him the earth was redder than most of what could be found within the forest. Rather than the source of red within the very center of the forest it continued to take a deeper shade of red from all that died within the forest. </p>
<p>Dead plants and creatures all the same gave just a bit of their red to the earth as they would lay there, lifeless, especially when the cold of winter brought by the great winds pushed deep even into the great forest.</p>
<p>Arayel moved along the path in one of the two directions, chosen at random. He moved and the earth didn’t feel all that special. It was still earth and still had the same properties as familiar, brown earth. A farmer would’ve been more interested in it, because all that was red would grow faster and larger than normally within that soil, but Arayel was no farmer. </p>
<p>He could feel the ground beneath him, and he could feel the aspect of red when he concentrated, but it merely added to the ambience of the forest as a whole.</p>
<p>The forest was red and because the aspect of red was so strong in the forest he could feel it, even though he had never sought to gain insight into the color. He moved through the forest at a leisurely pace, unhurried and unconcerned, taking in the surroundings with his senses.</p>
<p>Redwood forest was different, beautiful, more so than a common forest, not because Arayel liked the aspect of red particularly much, but because he could <em>feel</em> how it changed. </p>
<p>Rai was changed and where perfection had been unchanging, redwood forest had been changing for hundreds of years until it had become something more than a simple forest. </p>
<p>Arayel picked up a flower and it was a mixture of red and blue and he knew that sometime in the future every trace of blue would be gone. The second flower he picked was a glowing red, it was warmer than the other flower, taller, more vibrant and older. One had more power simply because it was redder than the other.</p>
<p> It was an expanding ecosystem, where the foundation of survival was determined by the aspect of red. </p>
<hr>
<p>The creatures of redwood forest were red. It was survival of the fittest as in any other region of the world and though some of them still observed the young man walking through the forest, most of them had returned to their search for food or water.</p>
<p>In the sky a red bird circled above Arayel, landing now and then on trees and branches. Its eyes were a deep red, deeper and grander than they should’ve normally been. It didn’t blink as it observed the ground. </p>
<p>Beside it a squirrel raced from tree to tree, smaller than a normal squirrel with differently proportioned limbs and a tail, longer than it should’ve been. It cracked a blue nut, revealing its vibrant red insides as it watched the human below, its eyes a deep, grand red.</p>
<p>A few more creatures observed Arayel as he trod on the path, but now only a few of their eyes bore the powerful, vibrant red, which meant so much on Ayith solely in redwood forest. </p>
<p>They weren’t dangerous nor did they have any intent for threatening Arayel. The deep, dark red eyes simply observed, out of curiosity, more than anything else. </p>
<p>It had already been quite a long time since Arayel set out from where he had started within redwood forest, more than an hour already in fact, when all creatures within that part of the forest raised their heads. </p>
<p>Arayel felt all noise within the forest stop for a moment and then suddenly darkness blotted out the sun. It wasn’t as dark as the night, but it was sudden. Arayel peered towards the sky and saw clouds, where there had been noone a second before. </p>
<p>The clouds formed and turned dark within a moment. They grew heavier as water gathered within. Arayel looked and saw something <em>dragging</em> the clouds. The birds were too far away to tell their size accurately and though they couldn’t be described as gigantic they were larger than birds should be. </p>
<p>It was a flock of them, not thousands but dozens, maybe a hundred and behind them clouds formed, not naturally, but because the flock passed over redwood forest. </p>
<p>Rain hit Arayel from above and it didn’t hurt, in fact it was refreshing, but most creatures retreated, shying away from it. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the rain was <em>blue.</em> The aspect of water outweighed the aspect of blue but as it hit redwood forest there was a slight conflict between the colors. </p>
<p>The flock of birds passed, and the clouds stayed for just a few minutes before they disappeared. The puddles of water in the forest slowly changed color, turning red as red overwhelmed blue. </p>
<p>Arayel was wet and felt a bit cold, but already he could feel the red warming him ever so slightly as the rain dried up on his clothes and skin. </p>
<p>The forest was in its essence still just a forest and the rain was in its essence still just rain, but here Arayel smiled. He felt red and blue and saw <em>change</em> wherever he looked.</p>
<hr>
<p>The longer he followed that path the <em>redder</em> the ground beneath him became, though it was barely noticeable<em>.</em> Slowly the shade of red deepened, the difference akin to how an apple grew and slowly turned from green to red. </p>
<p>And though that held true the difference in red could be felt more so through the gradual disappearance of all other colors. </p>
<p>The forest that had once been a lush green was now red and would turn increasingly redder as time passed. But where there was a path, not untouched wilderness, there was bound to be civilization and so Arayel proceeded deeper into the forest step by step.</p>
<p>After just a few hours, as the sun began to slowly vanish behind grand mountains on the horizon, Arayel stopped. </p>
<p>The forest opened as trees vanished before him, only continuing to his left and right. Instead the path led downwards on a very slight incline. There in the distance, at the very end of the path, lay a village. </p>
<p>In fact, the village wasn’t particularly special, not at first and truthfully just because it <em>fit</em> into the forest. The village wasn’t large nor small, it was just a simple village. A few hundred people called it their home, children, adults and elderly could be seen following different professions.</p>
<p>There were homes and fields, some larger, some smaller, but what had made the village grow and flourish over the last few hundred years was obvious at a single glance. It’s uniqueness lay in the aspect of Rai, surrounding and permeating throughout the people and buildings.</p>
<p>It was <em>red.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Arayel followed the path into the village as he observed it in its glory. The homes were red, the wood just as red as the surrounding trees. The earth, cultivated by the farmers living in the village, was as red as the forest. The plants flourished, nurtured by the red below, above and surrounding them in each direction.</p>
<p>His steps carried him into the village and soon he heard laughter amid cheerful, playful voices originating from where he could see children play just outside the city. The sun had yet to set, so many were still working on the fields, in their homes or in the surrounding forest.</p>
<p>Arayel could make out shades of lustrous red in their hair all around with only some still showing traits of blonde or brown, though all had at least hints and accents of red. Their skin likewise had a red hue, still clearly human, but also uncanny, slightly unsettling and foreign. Most of the clothing was red, though some villagers stood out, intentionally wearing vibrant blue, green or white. </p>
<p>Leisurely passing through the village he took in the sight and sounds of civilization, until he reached the tallest and grandest building near the center of the village. It wasn’t gigantic, rather just big enough to stand out without seeming out of place. </p>
<p>The building was filled with voices more voices than any other throughout the whole village as men and women, old and young alike visited the establishment. Unceremoniously a sign hung above the entrance declaring the building as the “Red Inn”.</p>
<p>Arayel pushed open the door and before him lay a room filled with the sounds of conversation. It wasn’t yet evening, so there was still room for more to fill the common room, but Arayel felt certain that soon most of the village would gather in the building.</p>
<p>In the corner of the room, he saw stairs leading to a second floor. Nonchalantly Arayel passed through the room and sat down at a table near a window.</p>
<p>The chair wasn’t the most particularly comfortable but that was no surprise. He sat down and listened first for a moment, then for a minute. He didn’t listen to any one conversation in particular, but the sounds were refreshing, honest, real. </p>
<p>Across the room a group of men were talking about work, complaining about hardships and exhaustion, though it was clear that they weren’t particularly serious from the tone of their voices.</p>
<p>Normally an inn would be filled with travelers and wanderers, but in the small village that was far from the truth. The village within redwood forest was unfamiliar and strange and so there were few that visited the place. </p>
<p>Because the inn wasn’t truly meant to be a place for travelers’ children were playing cards at a table, running outside and back in again countless, using energy only they could afford to still have as the sun set on that day.</p>
<p>There were different groups in the inn, some larger, some smaller, but because they were familiar with each other they mixed and mashed and sometimes stayed as one, but together they created an atmosphere of joy or something alike. </p>
<p>They fit into the room, the red swirling and flowing around their bodies the same as it did around the floor and tables. Only ornaments and clothes brought forth colors and accents, which were otherwise unseen in the forest.</p>
<p>Red, though beautiful and complex, didn’t seem special in redwood forest. The walls of the inn were red. The glasses and plates on some of the tables had a tinge of red in them. Light, turned red by the forest, shone into the room from outside.</p>
<p>They sat there, even their skin a shade of red, some more some less. What separated them all were their voices and their clothes, brighter and more colorful than anywhere else. </p>
<p>They fit in but also attracted attention because they chose their colors with great care, because black and white and gray stood out among a room full of red, more than usually. A few had even dyed their hair vibrant blue and purple.</p>
<p>Others embraced the red, because it was special even among the great wonders they knew of, some because it gave them power, here in this place, where the aspect of red changed the forest.</p>
<p>Among them Arayel sat in solitude, calm, relaxed, content to simply listen for the moment. </p>
<p>When the sounds of approaching steps resounded in his ears his eyes followed them. A rough and deep voice, not unfriendly, harsh or confrontational, but rather intrigued and slightly fatigued and strained greeted him as the man sat across him at the table.</p>
<p>“Good evening, something to eat or drink? There’s meat and drink directly sourced from redwood forest. Many could assure you of its quality, meat freshly hunted and prepared, vegetables and fruit gathered straight from the forest. Rooms are available from 8 Arkal a day. “</p>
<p>For a moment Arayel listened to the voice, as the words gained meaning inside his thoughts. Lightly his finger tapped bounced up and down on the robust table. For a moment he pondered what he should answer, but in the end words naturally formed.</p>
<p>“I’ve not visited an Inn in a long time. I might need a few minutes to decide.”</p>
<p>For a second the innkeeper man’s eyes met his, before he placed down a menu before in front of him. He evoked a sense of inherent politeness as he nodded at him, before replying with a slight smirk. </p>
<p>“Take all the time you need.”</p>
<p>Just like that the innkeeper rose up and visited another table, talking with the people, taking orders and handing out menus. </p>
<p>Averting his gaze, Arayel opened the menu, discovering light red pages, adorned with dark blue text describing quickly and concisely describing meals and drinks and prices. His eyes wandered over the numbers and letters and though it had been a long time since he could remember last having truly read something deciphering the meaning of the text felt familiar and natural.</p>
<p>There were drinks and meals, categorized, not simply by price but also by color. Half of the food and drink on the menu was red and there was a simple indicator categorizing locally produced food from redwood forest as well as more rarely food imported from outside the village. </p>
<p>The prize was given in denominations that Arayel had no recollection of, nor did he know what it stood for as it was given only in symbols he had never seen.</p>
<p>He browsed through the menu and could gleam the contents of most of the items. Most of the meals as well as beverages were likewise unfamiliar, meat from beasts or simple farm animals that was described to taste different, <em>redder</em>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before Arayel had finished the menu, closed it and laid it down onto the table. Meanwhile a few more people had entered the common room, while some had left.</p>
<p>For a bit he focused on observing a young man, transporting drinks and food to one table, before returning to a room in the back of the common room, empty plates and glasses on a tablet he carried. </p>
<p>Just then the innkeeper returned, observed him for a second or two, before sitting down across him again. </p>
<p>“My recommendation would be Varbas meat with potatoes and red Miligh sauce, not too spicy, but certainly better than anything you can get outside of the forest. Most travelers among those that have never been to Belior, truly seem to enjoy the taste.”</p>
<p>Arayel couldn’t help but sigh regretfully before lightly pushing the menu across the table, but there was nothing that could be done.</p>
<p>“To be honest I just realized that I don’t have any money. It’s been a while since I’ve had to pay for anything, so I guess I somehow forgot about that. I might return if I get the chance, but could you maybe you could at least tell me where to find the nearest city?”</p>
<p>Already pondering what he’d do next Arayel rose from the chair, but the stern voice from across stopped him.</p>
<p>“Wait. Stay for at least a bit longer. Even if you were to leave right now there’s no way to reach Refinel before night falls…”</p>
<p>Slowly the man drifted off, his words slowing as his thoughts began to wander. For a few seconds he was still and silent, before he met Arayel’s eyes. </p>
<p>“Stay here. At least until morning. I’m not going to stop you from leaving then, but I won’t let a child wander through the forest at night. Not normally and especially not without giving you anything to eat and drink.”</p>
<p>For a second Arayel was silent. He had been a child in the past, but that had been long ago. Certainly, he wasn’t powerful, but neither did he have a reason to fear the forest, after all he had already spent a few hours within until he had reached the village previously. But there was something else that made him reluctant to simply receive help without having anything to offer in return.</p>
<p>“I’m no child and neither am I helpless. I have nothing to give you, no money, nothing to trade and I don’t like being in someone’s debt.”</p>
<p>At those words the innkeeper began to observe him in greater detail. Clothes, unfamiliar, old and though not ragged or luxurious. No weapon in sight to protect him nor any money to buy even the least food. For a while his eyes rested on Arayel, his face, his eyes, his posture.</p>
<p>Then he rose from the chair across Arayel. Only slightly did it creak as he pushed it back towards the table and only a few words did he speak before he returned to the counter. </p>
<p>“You may not be a child, but you are lost and that’s even worse. Stay, eat and rest for a day or just this night. Follow me tomorrow and help me with some tasks if that makes you feel better, but I know that acting hastily will only make a difficult situation harder.”</p>
<p>Arayel didn’t reply as the man walked away, a few seconds later he leaned back in the chair and only lightly did it creak.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the young waiter he had seen across the room before approached, a tray of food in his hands. One he put down in front of Arayel, the other was for himself as he took the place across from him.</p>
<p>Two glasses, filled with a pink-reddish liquid had been placed beside the plates. A few ice cubes lightly swirled around inside the glass as the drink came to a still. Both plates were filled with red meat and sweet potatoes, covered by a vibrant red sauce. </p>
<p>“Varbas meat, potatoes and Miligh sauce, all locally produced in redwood forest. In my 4 and a half months of working I’ve yet to meet anyone who said they didn’t like it. Nilan juice, very sweet, but also really refreshing.”</p>
<p>The young man had a slight smirk on his face as he stared down at his own plate. Before starting the meal though he met Arayel’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Seems like the old man, the name’s Darius, really wanted to leave a good impression on you. Oh, and I’m Esik by the way.”</p>
<p>Arayel observed Esik for a moment, slightly startled by the man, but something about the young man naturally spread positivity. </p>
<p>“I’m Arayel, pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>Soon after he took his first bite of the meat and couldn’t help but admit that it tasted really good. </p>
<hr>
<p>“So, what do you think of it? Redwood forest, Belior, our little inn, like it?”</p>
<p>“Hmm... It feels… different. The grass, leaves trees, everything is so… <em>red</em>. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a red so… vibrant and alive, even though it doesn’t make any sense it just gives that feeling.”</p>
<p>Still Arayel felt difficulties when trying to put those feelings into words. He looked at Esik and saw the light red hue of his skin and felt like he saw the color <em>move.</em></p>
<p>Esik himself seemed truly nice and forthcoming. He talked naturally to Arayel as the food vanished one bite at a time.  </p>
<p>“You know, some think the red are part of some creature, or that the color itself is alive, but honestly, I don’t think anyone actually knows. I was born in redwood forest and have lived here since then, so I can hardly imagine living anywhere else.”</p>
<p>Throughout their short conversation Arayel felt like Esik’s every movement caused the red to swirl and twist. A light tap against the table caused the vibrant red of the wood to deepen and turn a different shade, but he didn’t notice and probably didn’t intend that to happen.</p>
<p>It swirled around his body and made his movements seem graceful and effortless, as if he were supported by it. Arayel couldn’t help but be intrigued at how the Aspect of Red had intertwined itself with everything within the forest, but a few things seemed peculiar to him.</p>
<p>“The Innkeeper, he’s called Darius, right?”</p>
<p>A light nod from Esik, before Arayel continued. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like the red has affected him as much as you, has it? Doesn’t seem like his skin has that same hue of red.”</p>
<p>For a second Esik paused, took a sip of the very sweet Nilan juice, before he answered.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I forget about it, because it’s already been more than a few yours, but Darius wasn’t born here. I think he had visited Belior a few times before, but only a few years ago did he move here.”</p>
<p>Arayel was intrigued.</p>
<p>“So, the red is something you’re born with?”</p>
<p>After pondering for a few seconds Esik shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Mostly, though I’ve heard that it’s possible to gain a certain sense of control over the aspect of red. Some visit the village trying to do exactly that, they go deep into the forest and though some return others are never heard from again. Those that do return though sometimes seem like completely new people and their connection to the color is sometimes deeper than even that of someone like me, who’s lived here their whole life.”</p>
<p>For a second there was silence, but Arayel voiced one of his questions soon after.</p>
<p>“…You said that some don’t return after going deep into the forest. I haven’t felt like there was anything particularly dangerous in here, but that sounds like I’m quite wrong.”</p>
<p>“I think you don’t have anything to fear. This village has existed for hundreds of years now and for generations there have been hunters who venture into the forest. They only very rarely report about dangerous beasts and since I’ve been born there has never been a case of one of them dying.”</p>
<p>For a moment he hesitated, but he sounded convinced. He did add one more thing though.</p>
<p>“Don’t go deep in the forest though, no one can guarantee your safety there and that’s where ambitious outsiders sometimes try to go. If you stay in proximity of the village or head in direction of Refinel it really shouldn’t be dangerous.”</p>
<p>Arayel nodded, hesitantly, but didn’t think Esik was lying.</p>
<p>They breached a few other topics, but the conversation wasn’t important, nothing that moved the world. A meeting, a bit of kindness from an old man a plate of warm food and the company of a nice young man. </p>
<p>The food was good, the meat was tender, and it tasted special, unfamiliar and new. The potatoes were roasted and the sauce complemented them nicely, a bit sweet, but maybe that was what gave the food its charm. </p>
<p>But more so than anything else the one thing that made it a must try in the inn was the fact that it was truly <em>red</em> all throughout. </p>
<p>It was visibly red, but that was only what intrigued you at the surface. No, it was special, because it <em>tasted</em> red, because it was eaten in redwood forest, grown there, and produced there. </p>
<p>It was spicy, but not too much so. The important part was the feeling. Something that looked red should taste spicy, it made <em>sense</em>. It wasn’t just spicy though; it was also warm. The plate had been hot when he had first received it and even as Arayel took the last bite of meat it was still warm.</p>
<p>More than that though, it felt like the food gave that warmth. It carried that sensation into his body and from there on it spread. Only vaguely could he still remember the taste of what he had eaten in the past, but this meal was warm and tasted just right more so than anything.</p>
<p>At last, Arayel put down the utensils.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been particularly long, but the common room had filled more than before as the day was slowly ending. In redwood forest more so than anywhere else the light of the descending sun turned everything red.</p>
<p>Across from Arayel Esik finished his glass of Nilan juice with one last sip, before reaching into his pockets and placing the item inside on the table. </p>
<p>“Up the stairs the last door on the left. The old man told me to make sure you had a place to stay, and I can tell you it’s better than most rooms even in the best inns in Refinel.”</p>
<p>With that said Esik took both plates and glasses with practiced ease and speed before returning presumably to the kitchen in the back of the room.</p>
<p>For a bit Arayel stayed seated at the table, observing the sunset, the forest, the inn and the people. He listened to the sounds of birds outside and the voices of the patrons inside, without really thinking about the contents. </p>
<p>Still, he could feel that slight bit of spice from the sauce on his tongue as well as the heat still lingering inside of his body from the food as well as the environment itself. </p>
<p> He grasped for the key laying on the table and didn’t feel the cold that is normally associated with metal. Lightly he stepped through the room, reached the stairs, ascended them and passed through the corridor.</p>
<p>Above the ambience was more silent, calmer, different. On small desks beside the doors of each room there stood vases with flowers and though some of them had tinges of purple and pink all of them carried a vibrant red. </p>
<p>Lightly the key clinked as he put it into the lock of the last door on the left and twisted it once. </p>
<p>Inside, the room was red. The bed, the sheets, the table at the window, the floorboards beneath his feet and the cabinet beside the bed. It was a red that didn’t catch the eye, because it wasn’t supposed to, instead it made the room look as natural and comforting as you could want.</p>
<p>Behind him he turned the key once more inside the lock and the door closed. </p>
<p>Arayel didn’t have much with him, no money nor any idea of where exactly he was. He sat down on the bed and observed the forest outside through the window, the pane of glass only held a slight tinge of red, one that didn’t obscure vision. </p>
<p>He peered through the window and observed the sunset. In the distance there were mountains, impossibly tall, swallowing the sun slowly as the day ended. Time passed and his thoughts calmed and came to a rest. Outside he could see the moon appear, replacing the sun bit by bit until only it was visible in the night sky. A single vibrantly green circle in the night sky. </p>
<p>The forest outside fell asleep. The aspect of Red lost part of its vibrancy as the dark cold green glow of the moon descended upon the world. </p>
<p>Arayel’s body relaxed and calmed as everything came to a rest. Slowly, his eyes closed, as fatigue from deep within him took hold of his muscles and thoughts wrapping around him and putting him to sleep.</p>
