   <h1><strong>1 Why?</strong></h1>
<p>How to define living? </p>
<p><em>Can</em> you define what it means to <em>be alive</em>?</p>
<p>Living means experiencing what this world gives you. You have no choice but to deal with whatever cards you were given.</p>
<p>Some seek their very own unique and important role. A destiny or fate of sorts. Something special to make their existence seem more important and special than it actually is. May they succeed.</p>
<p>Some curse the world with every fiber of their being. They learn to hate the world and everything within it through experiencing setbacks, pain and sorrow. They pose a question to the world. They ask for a reason, for why they are cursed and why they have to suffer. May they receive an answer.</p>
<p>But life isn’t just a coin. There are always more than just two sides. They aren’t black and white, neither are they yin and yang. Life is more complex than that. If you were to categorize the world into two types however you could certainly succeed in most cases.</p>
<p>Those who like and those who hate.</p>
<p>Those who feel joy and those who feel sorrow.</p>
<p>Those who still seek for answers and those who have already stopped their search.</p>
<p>Maybe that would allow you to place everyone in one of two categories. Or maybe it wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Life could be more or less complex depending on who you ask. </p>
<p>In the end <em>everyone</em> is searching for the answer, though some might deny it. Some phrase the question differently; some haven’t yet realized that they are posing the question.</p>
<p>It’s a fundamental and simple question, but at the same time a question as complicated as asking about purpose and fate.</p>
<p>Something that doesn’t require understanding.</p>
<p>Something that doesn’t need to be heard.</p>
<p>Something as simple as a single word.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<hr>
<p>His hands were still reaching. He was still searching. Still posing the question. </p>
<p>He was lost and because he was lost, he was searching. Searching for a way to escape or maybe to fix. But at the very least he wanted to understand.</p>
<p>They were there. The cracks. Cracks in what? In everything and then nothing. Sometimes they were gone one moment and then appeared in a dozen different places all at once.</p>
<p>At a first glance everything seemed <em>right</em>. There were humans on the road next to the pond. They were calling out to him, they were looking at him, but they didn’t <em>see</em>. Not how everything was falling apart.</p>
<p>They didn’t comprehend, and for a long time he didn’t understand why. Their words were how they were supposed to be, but he couldn’t understand what they meant. Somewhere along the way he had forgotten even the last of their language and now it seemed so foreign, he wondered if he had truly once been able to understand. </p>
<p>He looked at them and into them. One of them had been robbed of his legs, but hadn’t even noticed it, stumbling along, trying to walk, but unable to. One had been robbed of his blood, and he could see the crack right in the middle of his chest, his heart just gone. His body was cold and lifeless, but nobody else even saw it. </p>
<p>They followed the path and didn’t see when one of them stumbled into a crack. From one moment to another he was gone, but no one turned to see, to <em>search</em> for what had been erased.</p>
<p>In the past he had tried to save them, to communicate in any way. He had thought himself insane, but nobody acknowledged it. Only later had he understood that they couldn’t have.</p>
<p>The procession of humans passed by, and he wondered if once they had a purpose, if once they had lived as he had, but he hadn’t found anything that could answer him that question, so he had given up asking it. At least for now.</p>
<p>He turned away and slowly sank his hands into the crystal-clear water of the pond before him. He cupped the water with his hands, and it was neither too hot nor too cold. Same as always. Raising the water to his mouth he began to drink, slowly. He felt it run through his body, but he hadn’t been thirsty, never. Only recently had he begun to think that he needed to drink. To still thirst, where it hadn’t ever been.</p>
<p>It felt right even though it didn’t help him, even though he couldn’t recall where he had learned to drink not out of want but of need. </p>
<p>When he was done, he calmed his breathing, felt his heart beating, felt the spring green grass beneath him. He closed his eyes and thought, trying to recall the past, trying to understand one more thing, to find the answer to one of his questions. He felt lightheaded as his thoughts drifted away and sought out anything important. </p>
<p>Time passed slowly and fast at the same time, as he saw blurry memories, heard strange sounds incomprehensible to him. Then for a moment his breathing stopped and everything else seemed to vanish as a single word entered resounded in his mind.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and stared into the pond, into the water and into his reflection. </p>
<p>A word, a sound, a name.</p>
<p>An <em>answer</em>.</p>
<p>A question he had kept deep inside of him for as long as he could remember.</p>
<p><em>Who am I?</em></p>
<p>Yori.</p>
<p>Oftentimes he had bitterly looked at the noble clothes covering him, still as pristine as ever. But on that day, he didn’t see a reflection of himself but a single word, a single name and he knew that it was his important. </p>
<p>He still had so many questions in his mind, but now he knew the name that he had once been given. He felt that it described him, even though he didn’t know what exactly it meant.</p>
<p>With one question answered Yori rose from the ground and turned around. His firm steps resounded as he continued his journey, always searching, ever seeking.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not much was left of the city as Yori wandered through the ruins. Buildings, streets, people, laughter and color had been ripped and torn. He crossed the bridge but the riverbed below was void of water and even though a pristine palace lay before him there was nothing inside, no light nor darkness, no structures and no life. </p>
<p>The scene did not surprise him anymore, but something was different. Yori hadn’t realized it was there until his eyes caught sight of it. </p>
<p>Tiny, just the size of his palm <em>it</em> fluttered in the distance behind the slightly ajar gates of the palace. Dark purple and light pink the creature stuck out from its surroundings. The moment Yori saw it he stopped. </p>
<p>His heart started pounding and then it went faster than it ever should. He tried to stand but his strength wasn’t there, his legs gave out and he stumbled to the ground. His vision blurred as his hand hit the ground but couldn’t support him. Pebbles dug into his skin, but it didn’t hurt and neither did he bleed. </p>
<p>One hand reached for his heart to calm it, while the other grasped his head. Inside, it hurt. Boiling hot and then freezing cold, then both at the same time. In his ears sounds resounded, but he didn’t and couldn’t understand them.</p>
<p>He felt the tears running down his face, but nothing was there. He couldn’t see anything; it was too dark then too bright. The colors exploded and pounded like they were alive. He writhed on the ground, but he couldn’t feel his limbs, couldn’t control his body.</p>
<p>The sound drilled into his eyes and heart and mind and soul, resounding again and again and again. </p>
<p>He couldn’t feel anything, but his body shuddered. His blood froze but something else moved everywhere all at once before it was gone. </p>
<p>An image, a word, a feeling, sound, a horror. A question and an answer rushed through his body. A single <em>thing</em> was present and lodged itself into Yori. </p>
<p>Niskia. </p>
<p><em>Niskia.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Niskia.</em></strong></p>
<p>Three times it resounded within him and then everything was there again. Feeling returned to him and his strength slowly rushed back throughout his body. Yori didn’t know where he was nor what had happened. </p>
<p>He slowly pushed himself off the ground and let his gaze wander. </p>
<p>The palace had vanished, the ground had turned into perfect white and in the sky above, where there had once been the blinding light of a sun, now there was an empty void. Beyond, the stars were sparkling, brighter than the sun, impossible to reach. </p>
<p>In the next moment the first of the stars vanished. Behind it there was a single spark of dark purple and light pink, so tiny that Yori lost track of it a single blink later. </p>
<hr>
<p>Yori looked up, towards the night sky, towards the stars, tiny spheres of light, illuminating the world. He still felt lightheaded, his thoughts swirled and spun as he turned his head. The ground beneath his feet felt robust and hard, but it was pure white. </p>
<p>In the distance he could clearly see how it should have looked. Grey and black, accents of blue and red. Then there was a cut, a sudden change, unprompted and unnatural. Every bit of color was drained from the rock beneath his feet and what remained was pure white. It didn’t reflect anything like water or glass, nor could you see through it. </p>
<p>Slowly Yori began to move, passing over the changed ground and through the place where the palace had once stood. He stopped moving once he reached the end of the pure white ground. He touched both parts of the ground, observed both and tried to see something more, something deeper. </p>
<p>Clearly, they were different, but he frowned because it wasn’t just that had been changed. Something else had happened, something else had changed, something deeper and something that he couldn’t grasp. He didn’t know what he was searching, not even exactly what he had just noticed, but a question had already begun to form in his mind.</p>
<p>The traces were there, but they were too faint, too hard to grasp and so after a while he resumed his journey. </p>
<p>Sometime later, deep within a forest, he found a place void of life. Brown dirt covered bordered lush green grass and on it nothing grew. He was hesitant to step into the space, something told him that it was dangerous, perhaps an instinct that told all creatures to stay avoid the place like the plague. </p>
<p>Still, something inside him prodded him to stay and observe, to test and understand. Carefully he extended his hand forward, and even though his fingers trembled he continued. Then, when his fingers had barely passed over the edge, the invisible barrier separating that space, he felt that something was wrong. It wasn’t pain but rather the lack of any feeling that made him retract his arm immediately.</p>
<p>Raising his arm, he gasped before stumbling backwards. Sweat covered his body as he looked onto his hand in silence. The few fingers that had passed into the space were grey and dead, he couldn’t move that part of his hand and neither could he feel anything from it. The blood inside had stopped and died just as the nerves and muscles head. The flesh itself was dead and horrifying to look at. </p>
<p>He turned to look back at the area in the middle of the forest and realized that something fundamental and omnipresent had been erased from that part of the forest. Life itself couldn’t exist within the bounds of that space. No plants, no animals, even the air itself was simply gone. </p>
<p>Yori warily observed the area, but nothing else seemed to happen to it nor the affected part of his hand. Only on close inspection could he feel that something in was changing within his body. <em>Something</em> was healing what had been killed in his body. Very slowly but surely his cells, nerves, muscles and skin were regenerating. </p>
<p>At first, he thought his body was responsible, but there was something else. Something was healing him, and whatever it was it felt familiar, though Yori didn’t know how. He focused on that sensation, how it rushed into his body from outside. He couldn’t see its source, seemingly it came from everywhere around him, but he felt as if that <em>energy</em> was of greater importance than just healing him. </p>
<p>But there was something else, a feeling, a sense of inherent disapproval of the death that had affected him. He tried to glean more from that sensation, but it seemed to slip through his fingers no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>Somehow, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to understand more, even if he continued and so eventually, he averted his attention and continued his journey, while putting a lot of space between himself and the area of death.</p>
<p>Some time later Yori reached a large lake with water so blue he could barely look deeper inside. He stood completely still as he observed the tiny dot of pink and purple within the body of water. Somehow it couldn’t be missed even when completely submerged inside the vibrant blue.</p>
<p>He had no idea what the Niskia was doing, but it’s effect on him was a lot more bearable than it had been previously. He wasn’t sure what to do, but he knew that the Niskia were important and though he couldn’t guess at what they were he felt compelled to stay and observe.</p>
<p>Carefully he lowered himself to the edge of the lake, before lightly touching the surface of the water, producing slight ripples. He couldn’t peer into the lake but felt as if that was just one part of what it was made of. Instead of reflecting light the water took it in and turned it into a deep dark blue.</p>
<p>Slowly he dipped the fingers of his healthy hand into the lake and felt a refreshingly cold sensation. As his fingers slowly glid through the water he encountered barely any resistance whatsoever. Slight ripples spread outwards from where his hand touched the water at the slightest movement. </p>
<p>After retrieving his hand from the water, he could observe the deep blue sticking to his hand and swirling around on its surface without. The water clung to the surface of his hand, but slowly began to condense at the bottom before dripping down to the ground one drop at a time.</p>
<p>Upon focusing his gaze back at the center of the lake he could see purple deep within rapidly pulsating and expand, causing ripples to appear on the surface of the lake. One by one the purple waves grew to greater heights until they extended beyond the edge of the lake. </p>
<p>The water within the lake as well as the drops covering the ground beneath him turned more purple by the second. Once again Yori observed the water within the lake, realizing that it turned translucent, as if it was barely there anymore. Deep beneath him he could see the bottom of the lake. </p>
<p>His fingers tried to grasp the liquid, but it was if there was nothing there. The translucent water expanded toward the edge of the lake once again, but when the wave hit Yori he couldn’t feel anything. It wasn’t refreshingly cold anymore nor had it suddenly turned warm, instead whatever property it had once possessed was simply <em>gone</em>. </p>
<p>The Niskia was still hovering in the center of the lake, slowly flapping its tiny wings. All around the water had lost its color, its coldness, down to its very <em>essence,</em> so Yori understood when the water was suddenly <em>gone.</em></p>
<p>The Niskia fluttered its wings once more before it was gone. </p>
<hr>
<p>Yori passed through what was left of the lake, catching glimpses of the dead plants and creatures that had once inhabited the body of water. He was moving faster, his step quick, hurried, because he felt that time was running out. </p>
<p>Above the sky cracked and howled. Winds descended from the high above, pushed away by a dark mass of clouds that gathered before expanding in every direction. Soon the last drops of water that existed fell to the ground. </p>
<p>Rain.</p>
<p>Yori couldn’t remember ever having heard of it, but the word suddenly appeared in his mind as the drops hit his body. Beside him the liquid disappeared as soon as it hit the ground, vanishing upon making contact with the earth below. Like tears the drops fell faster and faster, unable to stay in the sky. </p>
<p>Beside them lightning hit the earth, and alongside the word that popped into his mind at its appearance Yori felt a sensation of dread from all around. </p>
<p>In the distance he saw flashes of purple, tearing down layers of the world, erasing everything in sight one by one, seemingly without rhyme or reason. Yori couldn’t remember when, but sometime in the past he must’ve begun to feel fatigue and exhaustion welling up from within him. </p>
<p>His eyes flashed back and forth, not focusing on any one thing, but observing destruction wherever he looked. Suddenly he was in the middle of a forest, but there were no leaves covering the trees, no beasts that should’ve called it their home. </p>
<p>Truthfully Yori didn’t think anymore, he moved based purely on feeling and instinct, losing track of time and space, passing through forests, mountains, fields and seas one moment after the other, unable to tell that nothing made sense.</p>
<p>He didn’t turn around, didn’t try to look behind but still he knew that there were an uncountable number of Niskia. As the rules of the world were slowly destroyed one after the other Yori’s mind turned and twisted trying to come up with solutions and explanations, but there were too many questions to solve. </p>
<p>Still somehow Yori was moving with purpose, his steps taking him ever towards the same place in the distance and he was making more progress than ever before. But time was also ticking faster than ever before. </p>
<p>Torrential rain and lightning were still covering the sky, but they too would vanish sooner than later. Beside him, cracks in space pulled at him and barely could he keep them from taking his form, color and thoughts. </p>
<p>A glance below and Yori saw the last bit of ground he could stand on, void of color and losing its shape every time the clock ticked. All around there was no air to breathe, but what was left in his lungs had to be enough. </p>
<p>Colors swam and swirled, combining and vanishing one after the other, but in the distance, beyond space that separated them, there was still something left. </p>
<p>Slowly sound vanished from his ears as less and less was still left. Only barely could the ground still carry his step, but it wasn’t far anymore. In his mind his thoughts could barely move, but he focused and saw a path in his mind and thoughts. </p>
<p>It was too late to move, he was too slow to reach but with the rules gone his thoughts ignored time. But even so there was nowhere left to step, almost the ground was gone, but why would he need ground to step on? </p>
<p>His legs moved and instead of stepping where there was no ground in front of him to step on, he simply moved where there was still something left. </p>
<p>Yori’s hand moved and pushed because there was something to push, pulled because there was something to pull him and moved because there was a place to move to.</p>
<p>And then he was there.</p>
<p>But <em>where</em>?</p>
<hr>
<p>Yori fell to the ground, desperately gasping for air. His legs still twitched and trembled, plagued by exhaustion, unable to move while his mind was spinning, the thoughts within swirling around aimlessly. </p>
<p>One, two, three deep breaths filled his lungs with air and brought a certain sense of calm with them. Slowly but surely order and calm returned to him and allowed him to let his gaze wander, taking in the place that he had sought and aimed for unsuccessfully until that very moment.</p>
<p>It was a place of great importance, which didn’t easily succumb to the Niskia. He could still feel them beyond, slowly encroaching and encircling, certainly aiming to invade, destroy and erase whatever lay beyond. </p>
<p>It was a place of peace and safety, but also of power and tragedy. But most of all it was a place that imparted him with emotions of comfort and joy, where there were no enemies, where no blood had ever flown and where no betrayal had ever occurred. They weren’t emotions that stemmed from him but rather from everything surrounding him. </p>
<p>But most importantly Yori clearly felt that the place held some of the answers that he had sought after for so long. He clearly felt that the answer to the most important question could be answered here in some way or form.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why?</em></strong></p>
<p>If you were to pose that question, then this place would be the answer. It held memories and emotions as well as events and stories. It looked mystical, because that was what it was, a place of mystery, a place where something of great importance had once occurred.</p>
<p>There was a waterfall, not particularly high and the water didn’t flow particularly fast. It streamed down from above, just a few dozen meters above the ground below. The water seemed peaceful and tranquil and no creatures could be found within.</p>
<p>But the water had power, it sparkled under any light, no matter if it came from a burning flame, a sun, a moon, or the stars. The water at the bottom of the waterfall was calm and not particularly deep, just enough to comfortably swim in. If the water had one special power, then it was that it seemed impossible to disturb and disrupt.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the water, it was <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>No one with ill intentions would find that place, because they would be repelled by whatever had given it form. It wasn’t where you would fight a battle to the death, but rather a place to recover in times of need and create friendships without malicious intent. </p>
<p>Beside the waterfall the grass was of a light teal color, it was soft and Yori felt calm as he passed through it, approaching the waterfall. Yori looked down and felt that everything here had energy, which was purer and greater than anything he had ever seen before.</p>
<p>If the humans he had seen were fake, imitations of what they were <em>supposed</em> to be then only this place could truly be considered real. </p>
<p>The water made Yori calm and as he sat in the teal grass beside the basin of water, he let his eyes close for just a moment. His tense muscles relaxed, and his heart calmed for just a bit.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, he felt as if he could more. <em>Clearer.</em></p>
<p>He observed his surroundings and realized that it was part of the answer he had searched for. But at the same time, he realized that he couldn’t understand it. He had searched for an answer and found it, but it felt so incomprehensible even though it was laid out right before him.</p>
<p>Yori let his eyes wander and scrutinize his surroundings, seeking to turn it into something that he could comprehend. He moved, turned, touched, heard and observed what was right in front of him and realized that it was too complex that even after years here, he wouldn’t understand the answer. </p>
<p>And there was something else he realized. Looking around he realized that something was missing, that this place should’ve been filled with life, with joy and laughter. But it was empty. Empty, because he was missing something that should have been here, but also something that they didn’t even know what it could be. </p>
<p><em>What was missing? What was wrong?</em></p>
<p>He saw the answer to his question and felt as if it were written in a language he didn’t know. </p>
<p>No matter how hard he tried to gleam something from this place he could never do it. Not how he was right now and not with what he knew. So he stopped and knelt down right beside the water to look at his reflection.</p>
<p>Yori submerged his hands in the water and noticed that it didn’t feel cold nor warm. It felt just right for that very moment and for him specifically. </p>
<p>Yori looked at his reflection in the water and didn’t like it, because it seemed so wrong at that moment. He observed his reflection and saw fear and restlessness. His face seemed pristine and perfect but without purpose, trapped on a never-ending search, for something that it could never find.</p>
<p>Yori looked and posed the question again.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>But he knew that the answer didn’t lie here, that it couldn’t be found anywhere no matter how hard or long he looked.</p>
<p>One last glance, one last glance and then he moved his hands to splash the water into his face. The water mended what wasn’t right, because the water had power. Slowly he felt something creeping up from deep within him. Something long forgotten, memories that had somehow, for some reason been buried.</p>
<p>Yori sat there for a moment and felt as if a weight on his body was being lifted. </p>
<p>His name was Yori. Yori because it had been given to him. Yori because it had been what he needed to be. It wasn’t a bad name, because it hadn’t been given with the intent of hurting him. But the name had lost its meaning all the same. </p>
<p>And so, he discarded it and felt the name <em>Yori</em> vanish.</p>
<p>He sat in a vanishing world, looking up to where the sky was supposed to be lightly chuckled.</p>
<p>Because he had found the answer to one of his questions.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is impossible to describe nothingness, because there is nothing to describe. </p>
<p>It could be defined as the absence of anything and everything, a space, where there was no light, no color, no warmth nor cold, no time nor space. Thinking about nothingness is useless, because why would you ponder the existence of something that fundamentally cannot exist.</p>
<p>Because it shouldn’t exist and is generally only perceived as a concept, nothingness is not something that causes worry and distress, but at that moment he had to disagree with that notion. </p>
<p>Logically he should’ve perceived something in that space, wherever he was, but he felt that there truly wasn’t anything at all at that moment wherever he was. </p>
<p>For a single moment he couldn’t remember who he was or who he had been. All sensation, all emotions, all memories were gone, but scarier was that he had naturally forgotten they were supposed to be there. </p>
<p>All he knew was that he was. </p>
<p>And then there was something else. A spark of something, but he didn’t <em>see</em> it, rather he was simply aware that something had changed, that <em>something</em> was there. </p>
<p>Slowly and quickly at the same time something <em>changed.</em> It happened not bound by space or time, it made no sound and neither could it be seen, it didn’t evoke any emotions or sensations.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Because it transcended those concepts, unable to be grasped by just one of them. A single word naturally came to mind, something that could give an idea of what it was. </p>
<p><strong><em>Change.</em></strong></p>
<p>Natural, true, destined and suddenly it occurred. Because it <em>had</em> to. Because it made sense for it to happen. </p>
<p>As the word resounded throughout his thoughts, he realized that it was an answer to a question that he had often posed, but never found the answer to, a part of the answer to the greatest of questions.</p>
<p>Slow memories replayed within his mind, depicting grand palaces, perfect symphonies, the most beautiful scenery. They had been everywhere he passed through, but still they were all destroyed by the Niskia, not because they were <em>weak</em> or <em>imperfect,</em> but rather because they were unchanging.</p>
<p>Never had he seen death, nor had he ever seen birth, no flower had ever wilted and so he had forgotten about change. Forgotten about that which should’ve been natural. </p>
<p>His thoughts swirled around in his head, pounding and resounding and when he looked, they appeared before his eyes. </p>
<p>Above him blinding bright light shone down, but it didn’t hurt his eyes. Suddenly the scene changed, and he fell from the sky, but when he landed his legs didn’t break. A flame sparked from the campfire before him at night, hitting the grass, the leaves, the forest all around, but it didn’t ignite, didn’t burn, didn’t destroy. </p>
<p>Nothing <em>changed.</em> No pain, no destruction, no sorrow, no blood, no death. Suddenly he recalled memories, concepts that he couldn’t remember ever seeing, but instinctively knew they were important, that they were supposed to have been there. </p>
<p>Scenes and situations passed through him, sometimes he saw them as memories, sometimes he felt like he was truly there, but all of them were unfamiliar.</p>
<p>But then he blinked and for a moment he didn’t see. For a moment he didn’t hear. For a moment he didn’t think. </p>
<p>A second passed and everything changed.</p>
<hr>
<p>For a moment the page was blank. Then there was white and black and a moment later they mixed into gray.</p>
<p>The gray turned red, yellow and blue. Then there was green and orange and purple. From one moment to another the page wasn’t gray but a mix of all colors and all shaded. The colors moved among each other until there were different streams, flowing fast and slow, some larger, some smaller, but all moving and mixing. </p>
<p>And he didn’t understand, not truly, he couldn’t put everything into words, because it wasn’t something he could grasp with a single glance in a single moment. He didn’t will the change, he observed it. He didn’t learn from it, he remembered, because he had once known it. </p>
<p>He didn’t try to gain insight from what he could perceive on the page. He simply observed and saw how everything slowly <em>changed.</em></p>
<p>The page changed and shifted, and he knew that what was written was the answer to a question. </p>
<p>He felt a plethora of emotions as he watched the process. He observed how everything changed and knew that what he saw wasn’t how it had truly happened. </p>
<p>The page folded in on itself and then suddenly it was so much bigger than before, suddenly the colors weren’t simply confined to the page, but sprang out and swirled and shifted all around. Then suddenly there was sound and scent. The rustled and shifted and then it burned and smoked.</p>
<p>An unfamiliar feeling of pain grasped his body for a moment it hurt even to think. The page was gone, but still the flame burned and though the pain ripped apart his thoughts, he still felt the flame move and expand and then suddenly, a new page was born from the flame.</p>
<p>A single page, then 7, then 983, then an uncountable number of pages flipped and turned and formed not a single book, but a story that was ever changing, ever shifting on every single page.</p>
<p>He was allowed a glimpse into how the pages and the story itself was written, not because he was its author, but because he already seen it before. Because he had forgotten something that should never have been forgotten even if all else vanishes and disappears.</p>
<p>Even though nobody had given it a name it naturally had one. It was more fundamental than time and space, because it was all there had once been. And though it has changed and taken countless different forms you could feel it and understand parts of it if you tried.</p>
<p>As he watched the process of <em>change,</em> he remembered. He didn’t understand because it was far too complex, but he didn’t have to understand to remember the name. </p>
<p>The pages flipped and turned, and he saw a world formed from water and earth. On another page he saw the sky filled with moons and stars and suns. Suddenly night turned into day as colors and sensations were erased and rewritten, bathing the page in the light of a new dawn. </p>
<p>On another page he saw how life was formed, the first flame as it burned, bright and hot, destroying and giving warmth at the same time.</p>
<p>He tried to keep track of the pages, but after a few moments they went by too fast to truly comprehend. Only sudden, momentary glimpses of concepts and colors, and sound, and sensations filled his mind. </p>
<p>Slowly an answer formed in his mind, a word that could answer even the greatest of questions. </p>
<p>A single page wasn’t enough to describe, but as the pages raced by the sounds and letters making up the word slowly put themselves together within him. </p>
<p>It was everywhere and everything, but nothing was purely it. What he saw wasn’t everything that it would ever be, because fundamentally it was constantly and consistently changing. </p>
<p>It was the answer to every question you could pose, but it was an answer that you wouldn’t ever be able to understand. </p>
<p>It was energy, but one encompassed everything. It was life and death, destruction and creation, complexity and simplicity. It was incomprehensible, while being known to all at the same time. </p>
<p>The pages were still drifting by, but when his hand reached forward it stopped. Behind the ever shifting and changing cover of the book new pages were still being added, but he had seen enough to know the title of the story. </p>
<p>His thoughts focused and resounded with a single word. In the center of the cover a single word appeared giving a name to the greatest of all stories. </p>
<p><strong><em>Rai.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>He opened his eyes, and the ever-expanding story of Rai vanished from his eyes. It had taken a single moment, but it had felt so much longer. </p>
<p>He still sat in front of the pond while the Niskia were still destroying the last of this world. His gaze slowly shifted and though he couldn’t see any more, finally he could grasp what led to the destruction of this world. </p>
<p>Lightly he shifted his body and noticed that there was something in his hands that hadn’t been there before. He looked down and saw the colors. He felt the texture of the paper. The page in his hands lightly rustled as he grasped with both hands. </p>
<p>Plenty of colors had mixed on the page, but he saw a hint of gold everywhere and though the page swirled and shifted the gold always stayed, unchanging, unwavering. Pleasant sounds entered his ears as he observed the page, but the melody was ever-glorious, ever-secure and safe. </p>
<p>He rose and passed through the vibrant teal colored grass. The page lightly moved even though there was no wind and so as he let it go it flew away, slowly fading out of existence. A moment of contemplation, a moment of thinking and finally he realized what was wrong with the page, with the world.</p>
<p>He had forgotten most of his childhood to the point where he could barely recall it as a blur, but he knew that it had been bright and joyful. Never had he seen pain and sorrow.</p>
<p>He couldn’t remember ever seeing anyone cry anything other than tears of happiness and joy but still he recalled crying out of sadness. </p>
<p>He recalled the past and realized that he had never seen rain before that day. </p>
<p>He turned his head and saw the Niskia swarming around that last sanctuary in the dying world.</p>
<p>Niskia were creatures that were inherently different and just now he could realize why that was the case. He couldn’t remember ever seeing them on any of the pages. He looked at them, but only felt more questions.</p>
<p>He averted his gaze from the Niskia, from the forest and from the rain beyond. He turned and walked towards the water. He looked down and saw that his reflection had <em>changed</em>. He looked and saw youth, messy hair, untended to, his clothes ragged and ripped in a few places. What he had previously seen was a reflection dyed in the Rai of this world.</p>
<p>He observed his reflection in the water and felt as if it whispered to him. He didn’t need to be told the word, he remembered it from so long ago, from a past long gone. The name that he had once been given, which truly belonged to him.</p>
<p><em>Arayel</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>He listened and thought, hearing the word resounding in his thoughts. It wasn’t important in the greater scheme of things. It didn’t give him power, nor did it help him escape that situation. </p>
<p>But still, Arayel felt better as the word embedded itself in his mind. Because it meant something to him, because it was his <em>name.</em> He stared at himself and suddenly he was smiling. For a second, Arayel simply existed, content and at peace.</p>
<p>Now that he had recalled Rai it seemed so obvious he wondered how he could’ve ever forgotten that most basic of truths. The knowledge made it all so simple to see why the end was near. </p>
<p>Arayel had noticed it in the water, that tint of gold, that sense of something regal and greater. His fingers lightly swayed the teal blade of grass and burrowed into the earth beneath. Once again, he saw that hint of gold.</p>
<p>He recalled the absence of insatiable hunger and unquenchable thirst, of sudden and unforeseeable death of loved ones, of pain and sorrow. </p>
<p>Now somehow Arayel wondered how he had never seen it before, the hint of gold, the absence of all things negative and wrong. This world was fundamentally Rai, but one that shouldn’t exist. The tint of gold that existed everywhere was only possible if everything was connected. If a single part was ever unchanging.</p>
<p>Arayel recalled what he had seen and felt and experienced and realized that it was an attempt at perfection.</p>
<p>The world was perfect and because it was, it was wrong. It was something to be admired and longed for, but it could never have been the truth, because Rai wasn’t perfect, but ever <em>changing</em>, beautiful in one moment and cruel and unfair in the next. To strive against the very nature of Rai and create an unchanging, ever perfect world should’ve been a fantasy first and foremost, but the attempt had been made.</p>
<p>The result was inevitable destruction and Arayel witnessed it. </p>
<p>The Niskia were still there, erasing everything, taking that hint of gold and following it, destroying it and alongside it everything it was connected to. </p>
<p>For a moment it seemed as if the end was near, but then the Niskia stopped, gathering somewhere above, ascending into the sky, beyond the stars and beyond where he could perceive. </p>
<p>For a moment he thought they were gone, but there was no saving the world. The world cracked and split, and the answer to a single question formed in his mind. </p>
<p>How does a world end?</p>
<hr>
<p>Arayel peered into the distance and saw the thunder striking down onto the ground. The rain flooded the world, circling around the center, where he stood. Wind took hold of the rain and made it orbit that last space of safety.</p>
<p>The water drops were caught in the air and blurred as they picked up more and more speed. Arayel could feel a sudden burst of cold as the rain turned to snow for a second. Then he felt warmth as the snowflakes unfroze and evaporated a second thereafter.</p>
<p>It was a dance of cold and warmth.</p>
<p>Then the lightning struck, ringing in his ears as it passed through the rain drops one after another. In the distance he could hear bursts of screams before they died down a moment later. </p>
<p>Arayel saw the world crack apart, but then that same splitting pain ran throughout his body. He tried to move but couldn’t, tried to close his eyes, but it was useless. </p>
<p>Only barely could he grasp something with his right hand. And then suddenly he felt it inside his palm, between his fingers, cold and unmoving. The feeling pierced him and suddenly he felt it all over his body. Arayel barely managed to turn his head up, only to see chains descending from the sky. </p>
<p>Unbreakable they descended from above and wrapped around and through his body. Link after link the cold steel had been wrapped around his arms and legs and heart and bones, binding him. Never had he noticed them, never had he felt them, but now that he could suddenly perceive them, he didn’t see that golden glimpse of perfection. </p>
<p>The chains weren’t part of the Rai of perfection, but neither were they like the Niskia, instead they seemed so out of place, so unnatural even in that moment.</p>
<p>But then, right as he first felt the cold metal on his skin, he heard a crushing sound from far above. Once, twice, thrice and then continuously the links of the chains broke one after the other. </p>
<p>High above, rain, fire, thunder, sorrow, death and the golden glint of the Rai of perfection surrounded and broke apart the links of the chains. </p>
<p>The world was dying and the chains that bound him to it were breaking link after link. The world was built up from perfection, and that aspect of Rai was gathering and revolving around the center of what was left.</p>
<p>But just a moment after the sounds of chain links breaking multiplied and rapidly increased. Only barely could he see the specks of purple without a shred of gold land on the chains and wherever they landed the links turned to nothingness.</p>
<p>Soon Arayel felt the first chain break away, rattling as it fell to the ground, rotten and unable to keep binding him any longer. Immediately he felt life fill his body where the chain had previously bound his heart.</p>
<p>When the second chain fell and let go of his lungs, he realized how ragged his breathing had been for years.</p>
<p>The chains fell apart one after the other, uncountable, and only once a chain was gone could he realize what had been taken from him. Life rushed into him with every breath he took even as the world ended, and more and more cracks appeared all around.</p>
<p>The chains fell apart faster and faster, and a feeling of familiarity that he had forgotten returned as he looked at the golden glint, the aspect of perfection. He didn’t know why but even so he felt a feeling of warmth and safety from the teal grass below and the crystal clear, calm water beside him. </p>
<p>The last chain dropped to the ground and vanished. </p>
<p>Then there was silence. Rai surrounded him and now it was calm. There was nothing left but the aspect of perfection.</p>
<p>Still the world was dying but for a moment everything seemed so calm and peaceful. A moment later he realized that nothing was moving, the rain drops, the wind, the flames, the sorrow, death, the aspect of perfection itself seemed to stand still.</p>
<p>And then suddenly it was there as if it had never been anywhere else. A Niskia floated before him for a second, then two and his heart didn’t beat, his thoughts stood still, for a moment everything stopped. </p>
<p>The Niskia floated right in front of Arayel, and it should’ve done something, anything at all, but in the next moment it was simply <em>gone.</em></p>
<p>Time resumed and every Niskia had vanished. </p>
<p>Only that golden glint was left, but it wasn’t long until it was gone. The golden Rai of perfection trailed into the distance before him and though his body moved and followed.</p>
<p>The Rai around him swirled and expanded, more golden, more perfect than he had ever seen. It led him and he followed even as the last drops of rain fell, and the last flame burned out. Even as the teal blades of grass beneath his feet were swallowed by cracks and destruction, he followed the courageous melody of the Rai of perfection.</p>
<p>Just slightly did he extend his hand forwards and grasp for the golden glint. A pleasant feeling welled up from within him, but then the stream of gold wavered and trembled just slightly. Just for a moment he felt it swirl and twist, but that was enough.</p>
<p>A single moment, a single instance but in that moment the Rai of perfection <em>changed.</em> </p>
<p>Only for a single moment longer did the aspect of perfection linger until it vanished completely.<br>The <em>illusion of perfection</em> broke, and the question was answered.</p>
<hr>
<p>The forest surrounding him was red. The trees looked like they bled, their bark dark red, maroon, rather than brown. Their leaves were of a lighter shade, a pleasant pink, jagged, but also elegantly swerving curves integrated into their patterns. </p>
<p>Bushes surrounding him all around had a red tinge, the berries they carried, ranging from dark violet to light pink all around, some with accents of blue or black. </p>
<p>Between the wine-red blades of grass or in the treetops above, as well as behind trees just a few meters away creatures, small creatures stared at him with eyes of a varying degrees of red. </p>
<p>Their fur was still brown in some of them, while already completely red in others and all of them stared curiously at Arayel.</p>
<p>Above him the sun was orange, bathing the forest in its light and warming Arayel. </p>
<p>Arayel took in the world and saw no hints of gold. Aspects of Rai filled the world all around. Red, nature, life, light, earth and an uncountable number of other aspects of Rai. </p>
<p>Had he not been overwhelmed with new questions and sensations he might have noticed the blood beneath his feet, but the hint of gold within disappeared quickly so it was quickly absorbed the aspect of red all around. </p>
<p>Arayel took in the Rai all around and felt how the world was <em>ever changing</em>. He didn’t hesitate, nor did he pose questions, not in that moment or place.</p>
<p>Instead, he took the first step forwards, passing through the red forest and smiled.</p>
